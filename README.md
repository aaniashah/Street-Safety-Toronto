# Street-Safety-Toronto
Exploring the City of Toronto's crimes, poles and road dataset to perform geospatial analysis of "hotspots" of danger in order to get a better understanding of areas to avoid.

The project is in its early stages of development. 

Relevant datasets pulled from the Toronto Public Safety Data Portal: https://data.torontopolice.on.ca/pages/open-data
Datasets of interest: Assault, Robbery, Homicides, Shooting and Break and Enter

More datasets pulled from City of Toronto Data Portal
Datasets of Interest: Poles dataset, traffic signal dataset

Roadblocks: Crimes dataset location corrected to nearest intersection, thus low-level location analysis can't be performed. Must bring scope up to neighbourhoods or areas.
            Poles datasets not given in lat, long coordinates. Some unknown coordinate system provided. Must decode.
